# F34 Release Party Map

This repository contains an 8-bit map created using Tiled and hosted on WorkAdventure. This was used for the hallway track of Fedora's 34th release party.



You can create a virtual character and move around and socialize on the map. When you are in close proximity of another player, you will enter a video call with them. The map also has jitsi meets you can enter when you sit on some of the tables. This map features an arcade, a coffee shop, a movie hall, a patio, a pool, a juice bar, a dance floor, and a giant piano.
