# F34 Release Party Map

### About
This repository contains an 8-bit map created using Tiled and hosted on WorkAdventure. This was used for the hallway track of Fedora's 34th release party.

You can create a virtual character and move around and socialize on the map. When you are in close proximity of another player, you will enter a video call with them. The map also has jitsi meets you can enter when you sit on some of the tables. This map features an arcade, a coffee shop, a movie hall, a patio, a pool, a juice bar, a dance floor, and a giant piano.

### Editing The Map
**Tools you'll need:**
* the Tiled editor software
* "tiles" (i.e. images) to create your map
* a web-server to serve your map (GitHub Static Pages in this case)

**Steps:**
* Clone this repo (keep it public)
* Scroll to the GitHub pages section on the settings tab and make sure that the gh-pages branch is selected
* Now the map will be hosted on gh-pages and you can get the link from the settings tab. 
* To make changes to the map, you'll have to edit the map.json file. Using Tiled is a very easy way to do this.
* To add more functionality like non-playing characters or tutorials or just about anything, you'd want to make changes to script.js
* Happy playing!
